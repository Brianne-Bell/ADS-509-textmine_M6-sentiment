    "**A:** The first artist is Cher and her top three songs of highest sentiment are: 'My Love' (.222), 'Sing for Your Supper' (.211), 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow' (.192). Her top three songs for lowest sentiment are: 'Bang-Bang' (-.246), 'There But For Forturne' (-.235), 'Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)' (-.182). I think the words driving the positive scores are 'love', 'good', 'sweet' since they appear often these songs. The top negative sentiment songs have a high presence of words like 'prison', 'jail', 'stale', and 'awful' which are all negative rated words based on the lexicons we are using.  \n",

    "\n",
    "**A:** The second artist is Robyn and her top three songs of highest sentiment are: 'Baby Forgive Me' (.241), 'Love Is Free' (.222), 'We Dance To The Beat' (.134). Her top three songs for lowest sentiment are: 'Don't F*cking Tell Me What To Do' (-.197), 'Don't F*cking Tell Me What To Do' (-.197), 'Criminal Intent' (-.100). She had the song 'Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do' listed twice in her file. The positve sentiment songs have a high prevelence of words like 'brave', 'smile', 'free', 'love', and 'proud' which increases the Bing Liu score. The negative sentiment songs are heavily influenced by words like 'killing' (appears in each and every line of the most negative song),  'f*cking', and 'criminal' and with the high prevelence of these words, the score is decreased drastically. This drastic score difference can be seen from the top two negative scores of -.197 increasing to -.100 when the top two songs have at least one negative word on each line.\n",
